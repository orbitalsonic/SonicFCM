# FCM

FCM is a [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) Android library that demonstrates registering your Android app for notifications and handling the receipt of a message. Example Send Data Message using the HTTP protocol with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

## Getting Started

### Step 1

[Add firebase to your Android App](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)

#### Note:
After completion of step one, your project should have a google-services.json file added to the root of your project along with the classpath, plugin and dependecies

#### Classpath in project level build.gradle
```
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:latest-version'
```
or latest
```
    id 'com.google.gms.google-services' version 'latest-version' apply false
```

#### Plugin in App level build.gradle
```
    id 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```
#### Dependencies
no dependencies required

### Step 2

Add maven repository in project level build.gradle or in latest project setting.gradle file
```
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
```  

### Step 3

Add FCM dependencies in App level build.gradle.
```
    dependencies {
             implementation 'com.github.orbitalsonic:sonicfcm:1.0.3'
    }
```  


### Step 4

Finally intialize Firebase and setup FCM in application class or in your "MainActivity"

```
    SonicFCM.setupFCM(this, "YourTopicName")
```


### Remove

If you want to stop receiving notification from the subscribed topic simply call.
```
    SonicFCM.removeFCM("YourTopicName")
```

# Send Data Message using the HTTP protocol with POSTMAN

### Step 1

You have to copy Legacy Server Key from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Cloud Messaging

#### Note:

Firebase has upgraded our server keys to a new version. You may continue to use your Legacy server key, but it is recommended that you upgrade to the newest version.
If anyone else is facing any issue then First Enabled "Firebase Cloud Messaging API" from Firebase console.
