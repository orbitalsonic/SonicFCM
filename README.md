# FCM

FCM is a [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) Android library that demonstrates registering your Android app for notifications and handling the receipt of a message. Example Send Data Message using the HTTP protocol with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

## Getting Started

### Step 1

[Add firebase to your Android App](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)

#### Note:
After completion of step one, your project should have a google-services.json file added to the root of your project along with the classpath, plugin, and dependencies

#### Classpath in project-level build.gradle
```
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:latest-version'
```
or latest
```
    id 'com.google.gms.google-services' version 'latest-version' apply false
```

#### Plugin in App level build.gradle
```
    id 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```
#### Dependencies
no dependencies required

### Step 2

Add maven repository in project-level build.gradle or in the latest project setting.gradle file
```
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
```  

### Step 3

Add FCM dependencies in App level build.gradle.
```
    implementation 'com.github.orbitalsonic:SonicFCM:2.0.0-alpha-01'
```  


### Step 4

Finally, initialize Firebase and setup FCM in the application class or your "MainActivity"

```
    SonicFCM.setupFCM(this, "YourTopicName")
```


### Remove

If you want to stop receiving notifications from the subscribed topic simply call.
```
    SonicFCM.removeFCM("YourTopicName")
```

# Send Data Messages using the HTTP protocol with POSTMAN

### Step 1

You have to copy the Legacy Server Key from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Cloud Messaging

#### Note:

Firebase has upgraded our server keys to a new version. You may continue to use your Legacy server key, but it is recommended that you upgrade to the newest version.
If anyone else is facing any issues then First Enabled "Firebase Cloud Messaging API" from the Firebase console.
